# Data Analysis Project -- Indian Start-up Funding Analysis

In this project, I explored the funding to Indian start-ups from 2018 to 2021 to help my hypothetical team which is trying to venture into the Indian start-up ecosystem make an informed decision.

I used Python and Jupyter for this project.

## Column names and description:
-   **Company/Brand**: Name of the company/start-up. String.

-   **Founded**: Year start-up was founded. String.

-   **Sector**: Sector of operation. String.

-   **What it does**: Description of Company. String.

-   **Founders**: Founders of the Company. String.

-   **Investor**: Investors. String.

-   **Amount(\$)**: Funds raised. Float.

-   **Stage**: Round of funding. String.

 
## Hypothesis

Null Hypothesis: Indian start-up funding was severely (negatively) impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Alternative Hypothesis: Indian start-up funding was not severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.

In line with the above, several questions were asked and some findings made accordingly.


## Conclusion
After extensive data analysis the formulated hypothesis was rejected

## Recommendation
To the Team, prioritize investment into the Fintech sector as the pandemic and its ensuing lockdown increased preference for online transactions and also invest into the educational sector as insights from the data shows that, the educational sector received a significant funding before after the pandemic (your return on investment is assured). Secondly, you may have to seek alternative sources of funding within the first year of operation as you look forward to a funding round.


Thank you.
